experiments on the road to Go

Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. 

I consider myself a 'go-bie'. I moved from 'interested' to 'committed' after listening to some of Rob Pike's talks on the language.  In time, I hope to become a 'gopher', and possibly even a 'go-ru' (in 10-15 years).

This repo will probably be of no interest to anyone but myself.  I promise the code will be horrible. (So don't use it as an example.)  I do *expect* the code to improve over time.  If a particular piece of work becomes usable, I will break it out into another repo.
